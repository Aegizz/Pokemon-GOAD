I’m Ash Ketchum. I’m ten years old, and I’m on my journey to become the greatest Pokémon Master of all time!
As I travel with my friends, Brock and Misty, along with my Pokémon, we work together to battle gym leaders and discover many new and amazing Pokémon!

I travel with my best buddy pikachu. I use him for everything even my passwords!
